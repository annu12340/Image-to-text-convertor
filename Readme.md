# What the text? 

It is a simple OpenCV program that performs OCR (Optical Character Recognition). This model allows the user to capture an image using the camera of the device and this image in stored in the local system. Later using Python libraries such as wand, pytesseract, cv2, and PIL the text from the image is reognized and stored into a text file.
